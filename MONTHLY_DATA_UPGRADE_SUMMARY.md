# Monthly Data System Upgrade Summary

## 🎯 User Request
The user requested a complete overhaul of the monthly data capture system at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/monthly_data` to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.

## 🏗️ New System Architecture

### Instead of the old bulk-entry form, users now have:

1. **Simple Income Entry**
   - "Add Income" button → Modal with bank selection + amount + description
   - Each income item recorded as individual transaction
   - Categories: Salary, Freelance, Investment, Business, Other

2. **Simple Expense Entry**
   - "Add Expense" button → Modal with bank selection + amount + description
   - Each expense item recorded as individual transaction
   - Categories: Food, Transportation, Shopping, Entertainment, etc.

3. **Fixed Expenses Integration**
   - Shows all active fixed expenses for the month
   - "Mark as Paid" button for each expense
   - Select which bank account the expense was paid from
   - Automatically creates expense transaction when marked as paid

4. **Closing Balance with Auto-Balancing**
   - Set actual closing balance for each account
   - System calculates: Expected = Opening + Income - Expenses
   - Any difference automatically becomes "Misc Income" or "Misc Expense"
   - Keeps books balanced while accounting for untracked transactions

5. **Opening Balance Management**
   - Easy inline editing of opening balances
   - Quick set buttons for each account
