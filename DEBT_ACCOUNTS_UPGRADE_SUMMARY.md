# Debt Accounts Upgrade Summary

## üéØ User Request
The user requested that loan accounts and credit cards should behave differently from regular bank accounts in the monthly data system, with a focus on debt management rather than asset tracking.

## üèóÔ∏è New Debt Account System

### Different Interface for Credit Cards & Loans

**Instead of regular income/expense tracking, debt accounts now have:**

1. **Opening Balance (Owed)**: Amount owed at the start of the month
2. **Paid Amount**: Payments made to reduce the debt during the month
3. **Closing Balance (Still Owe)**: Amount still owed at the end of the month
4. **Monthly Spend**: Auto-calculated as `Closing Balance - Opening Balance + Paid Amount`

### Mathematical Logic

The monthly spend calculation follows debt account logic:
```
Monthly Spend = Closing Balance - Opening Balance + Paid Amount

Example:
- Started month owing ‚Ç¨1,000 (Opening Balance)
- Made payments of ‚Ç¨200 (Paid Amount)
- End month owing ‚Ç¨1,100 (Closing Balance)
- Monthly Spend = 1,100 - 1,000 + 200 = ‚Ç¨300
```

This means you spent ‚Ç¨300 on the credit card during the month.
